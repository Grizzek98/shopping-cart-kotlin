# Overview

The purpose of this project was to learn the basic syntax and functionality of the Kotlin programming language

This is a recreation of my basic shopping cart program using Kotlin.
The user can add, remove, and modify items in a shopping cart.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
